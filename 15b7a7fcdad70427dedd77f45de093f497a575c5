      "message": "I am concerned that this permits probing of the name space.\nBy doing mkdir user@domain/a/b/c I can see if \"b\" is a file, by seeing whether I get a NotDir error. I can also see if /a or /a/b are links because I\u0027ll get ErrFollowLink.\nI thought we were trying to prevent this kind of probing?\n\nHere\u0027s how I think it should work: this code should walk up the path from the root, looking for Access files and noting the deepest one found.\nIf it encounters a link along the path, it should only return ErrFollowLink if the user has access to List the link name.\nIf the put/mkdir is trying to create an entry inside a non-directory, the user should only get the NotDir error if the have List access to the file in question.\nIn all other cases they should get a NotExist error.",

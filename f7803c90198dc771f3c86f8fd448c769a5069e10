      "message": "as described in mail, change the API so there is no Exit, just a Cleanup or Shutdown and it calls a user-provided function. this will remove all the dependencies on implementations.\n\nthere should be no dependencies on the implementations, for multiple reasons including cleanliness and maintenance. tomorrow i write a new implementation; i should not have to update this package (which i might not even have access to) to test it.\n\nthere will likely be other adjustments to clean them all out, so it can wait for a later CL if you want but it must happen.",

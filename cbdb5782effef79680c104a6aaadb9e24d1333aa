      "message": "Ha! You found the reason why I had put it there in a previous CL, even though you were against it because \"adding a sleep is hardly ever the right thing to do\".\n\nI\u0027m fine with this as a catch-all for other problems, but as you pointed out it is not the best fix. \n\nThe reason why this becomes a busy loop is because of a bug in rpc/client.go. In reality, the error you\u0027re likely seeing is that there\u0027s no root for the user and that is not supposed to be an Events.Error, but instead a dir.Watch error. The dir/server handles it that way and rpc/server handles it that way too, but rpc/client does not. I will file a bug and fix that. Then we can figure out if the sleep here is necessary for other error cases.",

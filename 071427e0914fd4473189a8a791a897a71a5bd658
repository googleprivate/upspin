      "message": "Better.  It is not incorrect as stands, juist misleading.  Though read-only is a bogus description. Just no longer writable by the original writer.  For example, if rob was the original writer, I have rw access, but rob now only has read access or no access at all, it is not a read-only file but this change blocks me reading it.  Rather than over qualify, why not just say \"potentially blocking legitimate files\". You\u0027ll probably change what it does soon enough anyways.\n\nI\u0027m a hater of word smithing but when I walked into the middle of this conversation earlier this week, the language being bandied about was so imprecise about a subject that revolves around precision that it took me forever to figure out what you were talking about in order to judge the implications.",

See documentation for client.Glob:\n \n        //  Note that if links are\n\t// evaluated while executing Glob, the Name fields of the returned\n\t// DirEntries might not match the original argument pattern.\n\nEither you\u0027ll want to use dir.Glob or perhaps do a client.Lookup on name with followFinal \u003d false and figure out if it\u0027s a link.\n\nAt that point, you may need to break these cases down as it\u0027s getting hard to read. Maybe the block below could be a local func. Then you may have these various cases be a switch statement or separate ifs. But it depends what this looks like once you have the link issue sorted out.",

      "message": "Well, it\u0027s not exactly silent;  err is not nil if factotum is not set.\n\nBut I tend to agree with the larger point that if factotum is nil then err should have a specific form that cmd/storeserver can check for.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027d be happy to abandon this CL and let you revise the code as you like.  I think you have a better idea of what you\u0027re seeking than I do.   (And I have to leave shortly for the day.)",

We probably don\u0027t as the storeserver might become a hotspot if it has to download data from GCS and funnel them all through it. \n\nSure, it\u0027s a matter of scaling the storeserver, but we have a mechanism to do this cheaply, which is the redirection of location -- in this case, to the GCS public service itself. We should use it.",

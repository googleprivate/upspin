      "message": "the problem with this approach is that when it goes wrong the test failure is uninformative and you need to read a regexp to know what went wrong.\ni\u0027d make this a slice of string pairs, one prefix and one suffix, and loop over the error line by line. then you can give a helpful message. (matching \\d+ is unnecessary)",

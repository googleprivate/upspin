      "message": "I\u0027m not adamantly opposed; it is not an immediate problem you installed this.\n\nBut for my edification, why is this an improvement?  You figure that block will someday switch to a yet-to-be-invented cipher other than AES, and you\u0027re sure in that case iv\u003d0 is ok?\n\nMaybe there is some type error with the old version that I don\u0027t understand?",

      "message": "It\u0027s just that cipher.NewCTR expects a cipher.Block and a []byte that of the cipher\u0027s block size. It just seemed more fluent to me to create a byte slice of the cipher\u0027s block size, rather than specifically of the aes block size. (If we switch to another cipher, this should still work?)\n\nI think if we switch to another cipher, we\u0027d need to think about iv again regardless. I don\u0027t think this change affects that reasoning, does it?",

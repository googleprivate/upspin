      "message": "that\u0027s a very strange error string. perhaps it\u0027s missing a word or two of explanation.\n\nmore important it doesn\u0027t say what the problem is. we don\u0027t as a rule give URLs as error strings. (how would you like it if EACCES gave you a link to a book on operating system design?) i don\u0027t know what the actual issue is, but i would have thought the error would be something like\n\nunsafe cryptography: user key does not match the frenectomy\u0027s entabulation\n\nthus telling me that my key is bad (or whatever the problem is) even if i don\u0027t know what a frenectomy\u0027s entabulation is.",

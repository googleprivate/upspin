The keys in this directory should be generated from a secret seed known to the
Upspin core team using this command:

	$ upspin keygen -where=$GOPATH/src/upspin.io/key/testdata/test-friend -secretseed <seed>

The keys are secret and must not be checked in to the repository.
A .gitignore file in this directory guards against this mistake.

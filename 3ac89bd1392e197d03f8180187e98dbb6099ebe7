      "message": "It\u0027s safer to check whether the peer\u0027s public key is on the curve before any calculation.\nThere is a way to bypass the check after calculation, i.e., I could make a public key invalid (not on the curve) and make the final result is on the curve. For instance:\nConsider Edwards curve:\n      x^2 + y^2 \u003d 1 + 3 x^2 y^2 over F_17\nThe point (3, 8, 1) is *not* on the curve.\nHowever: 2*(3, 8, 1) \u003d (3, 8, 1) + (3, 8, 1) \u003d (13, 14, 16) \u003d (4, 3, 1) is on the curve.",

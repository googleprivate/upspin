      "message": "My use case is to report internal logic issues and programming errors. Something like \"Internal Server Error on line 17\" should help us, even if does not help the user. As is now, the user will see an \"Other error\" with a similar cryptic description. \n\nWe can live without it, but the purpose of this package is to make error reporting a little nicer. I think error kind Internal can help.\n\nAbandon? Commit?",

      "message": "Use case: in the code for Tree (and also in the GCP code) there are assert-like checks that return errInternalInconsistency. That error Kind is not listed anywhere. In some cases it\u0027s data corruption, so it could be IO. But it will most often be a programmer error that I want to guard against: why are you trying to flush a non-dirty block? Perhaps the code that put it in the flush queue was missing a dirty check somewhere. \n\nWe can report Other too. But I don\u0027t see why not add something more descriptive. Is this going to make the code worse, slower, bloated with dead code? It\u0027s a valid use case, in my view. \n\nI see no reason not to have it.\n\nAlso: I added interpretation of the line number here too. I think that will be more contentious. You seem to have missed it. :-) Refresh to the newest patch.",

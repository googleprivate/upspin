      "message": "There\u0027s more to authentication than just this (though, this is the bulk of it to be sure). I\u0027d suggest a small refactoring of server.go\u0027s Authenticate method to expose the auth token validation pieces, so we don\u0027t have to maintain them in two places. It would include the time quasi-synchronicity test as well, which ehg had mentioned is important (I think, to avoid playback attacks, but maybe it\u0027s something else).\n\nIf you prefer, I can do that in another CL once this is in.",

      "message": "I agree that validating the parsing should be done in one place.  I don\u0027t to time validation here because I\u0027m using a challenge/response which I like a bit better, but I guess I could get rid of the challenge and use the time here also.  I actually dislike the time just because its the only place where we require syncronized clocks.  I\u0027d rather get rid of it altogether since its a requirement we really shouldn\u0027t need.",

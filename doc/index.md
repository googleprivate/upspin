Upspin is an experimental project to build a framework for naming
and sharing files and other data securely, uniformly, and globally:
a global name system of sorts.

It is not a file system, but a set of protocols and reference
implementations that can be used to join things like file systems
and other storage services to the name space.

Performance is not a primary goal. Uniformity and security are.

      "message": "Maybe add to the comment that this is the default packing if there\u0027s no overriding packing depending on the situation. For example, if the user is creating a file in a \"public\" directory that requires plain packing, the \"inherited\" packing via the directory structure will override this. Is that your expectation too?\n\nSuggested edit: \n\n// Packing is the Packing to use when creating new data items when no overriding packing is present via the directory structure [or ACLs?]",

Is there anything that could be done to improve the tests and make them catch these issues (if they were to regress) even when run on our local dev machines (where they currently pass every time)?",

      "message": "You\u0027re right, there should be more tests. I added some tests for the behavior of Tree.PutDir. Thanks for prompting me.\n\nI don\u0027t think we need to test for the race conditionÂ itself, as snapshot creation is entirely performed within PutDir with the tree lock held. Any test for the race would be a test fo Go\u0027s sync.Mutex implementation, which is already well-tested.",

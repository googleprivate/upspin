      "message": "This is a question that comes to mind, I\u0027d like to ask it.\n\nThis CL seems to fix pretty significant issues, yet the tests only failed on CI servers, and only sometimes. Is there anything that could be done to improve the tests and make them catch these issues (if they were to regress) even when run on our local dev machines (where they currently pass every time)?",

Thanks for prompting me.\n\nI don\u0027t think we need to test for the race conditionÂ itself, as snapshot creation is entirely performed within PutDir with the tree lock held. Any test for the race would be a test fo Go\u0027s sync.Mutex implementation, which is already well-tested.",

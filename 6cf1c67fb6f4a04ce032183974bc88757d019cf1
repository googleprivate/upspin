For backward compatibility you could have then linked them back to the old names but at some point in the future, the only thing you would have would a directory with a bunch of user names in it.  For me, visually appealing.",

Aren\u0027t you just going to continue writing at some place past the end of the file forcing the intervening space to be nulls?\n\nOf course, I don\u0027t like this truncation thing.  I really think you should just read ahead a byte at a time till you reach something that checksums correctly.",

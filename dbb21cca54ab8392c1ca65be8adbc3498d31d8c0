      "message": "Rather than removing the check entirely, should we ask Factotum to confirm it is ok by requesting the PublicKey?\n\nMore generally, I can imagine that there will be obscure bugs caused by a Factotum that has lost its keys or never been initialized, and we want to be sure we give a good error message.  I\u0027m not sure at the moment where that belongs.",

      "message": "I removed this because Debug pack does not use the Private key at all (or the Public one either). It creates a random byte as the key. So, as it\u0027s written, Debug pack *can* be used with a bogus (or even nil) Factotum (maybe it shouldn\u0027t).\n\nAnyway, I can check len(context.Factotum.PublicKey) \u003e 0, but it\u0027s probably not the right thing to do here given how Debug pack works right now.

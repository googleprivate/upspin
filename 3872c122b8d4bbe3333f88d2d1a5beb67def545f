That\u0027s worrisome.\n\nI don\u0027t mind that the app is read-only for now.  But information like Writer and Packdata seem relevant even for reading.",

      "message": "Yes. This is the kind of thing I am worried about. We don\u0027t have a satisfactory implementation for ourselves yet, and this proposes weakening even that.\n\nOnce we have a working system, we can have a conversation about interoperability. We could even have the conversation before. But a mobile app is not the right starting point.\n\n\nI can explain this better in the meeting.",

There are likely to be other messages in the system by the time we\u0027re done, and it\u0027s likely a program will depend on several of them. Plus it\u0027s not specific, but this is a very specific package.\n\nThis package is really about JSON on the net. How about jsonmsg? If json\u0027s in the package name, client code will be easier to understand.",

      "message": "I would find it helpful if we clarify here what happens for non-snapshot links.  Is Name typically the flattened version?  (I think so, given the comment below.)  Is SignedName?\n\nBut possibly once this all settles it will seem silly to have explicitly documented here, and we surely want to keep upspin.go as small as possible.  So treat this comment as a very mild suggestion.",

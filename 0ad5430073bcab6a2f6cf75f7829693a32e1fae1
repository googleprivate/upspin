      "message": "You\u0027re right, this is only strictly necessary if I\u0027m looking at a \"required\" field that does not have a \"count\" leading it (and the next entry does have a count leading it).\n\nHowever, the pre-existing nil check is necessary because otherwise we could start reading the next dir entry in a big block (if there is a next one, say in a big dir block). Because dir entries begin with a name, we could unmarshal the *next* SignedName correctly into this entry\u0027s Name field. And if this error pattern persists, we\u0027d only get an error message at the very last block, which would make debugging harder.\n\nGiven that a nil check is necessary and we know we need at least a zero for the next entry, I think this is safer.\n\nI hope this makes sense.",

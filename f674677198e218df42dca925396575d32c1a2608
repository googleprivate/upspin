      "message": "Not sure I understand.  len(buf)%2 makes is checking for a last element that is two bytes long which causes the confusion since that could clash with a directory name.  Hence the padding.  I don\u0027t understand the rest.  It seems like the predicate should be len(buf) \u003c 2*numDirs+1 since only the first numDirs elements can be ambiguous.  Everything after that is a file.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure numElems is making this any clearer but that\u0027s probably just me.",

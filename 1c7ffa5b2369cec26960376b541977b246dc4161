      "message": "Servers don\u0027t need to resolve links, right? The client will do that.\n\nUnless you\u0027re referring to links to this dir itself. But that\u0027s not always possible to resolve from a pathname, right? \n\nIn summary, I don\u0027t think I need a boolean here. \n\nCheck the tests, they cover all possible cases now. I\u0027ve added the only missing one which is Lookup the link itself (the case you mentioned below and was covered, indirectly by Delete, but is now explicit).\n\nThanks.",

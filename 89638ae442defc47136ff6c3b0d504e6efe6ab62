      "message": "That\u0027s a good point. The original idea was that user@example.com would trigger the creation of user+snapshot@example.com. But user+camera@example.com would only attempt to create user+snapshot@example.com (and if it existed, leave it alone). \n\nCurrently, there\u0027s no support for user+camera+snapshot@example.com.\n\nIf we want that, we need to change a few other things here and in DirServer. Let\u0027s talk about the exact semantics at the meeting.\n\nThanks.",

      "message": "Since this is only used by the link subcommand, I\u0027d be inclined to remove it from this package and put it into cmd/upspin/link.go.\n\nBut this is an odd way of going about doing what we want to do; really we just want to do a single Lookup of the destination to make sure it exists. I\u0027m not sure we need do anything beyond that. So maybe a helper function doesn\u0027t really buy us anything.\n\nWant to try that?",

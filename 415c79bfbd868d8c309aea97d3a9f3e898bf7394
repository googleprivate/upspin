      "message": "The answer to the first two questions is \"I don\u0027t know.\" Which is sad. I\u0027d like to make this more robust, however...\n\nThere is a Service Management API we can use, but ironically you need to enable it before you can use it! (catch-22). The gcloud tool uses a separate authentication token to get around this, which is why I\u0027m shelling out to gcloud instead of using that API. :-/",

That would prevent future parsing errors since just flipping that one on seems safer as you don\u0027t need to list anything.\n\nJust a thought.",

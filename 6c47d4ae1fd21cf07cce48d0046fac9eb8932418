Here\u0027s me taking a stab at what I think this does:\n\nHKDF cryptographically mixes salt, info, and the Factotum secret\nand writes the result to out, which may be of any length but is\ntypically 8 or 16 bytes. The result is unguessable without the\nsecret, and does not leak the secret. For more information, see\npackage golang.org/x/crypto/hkdf.",
